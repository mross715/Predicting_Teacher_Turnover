# Overview
project overview

# Business Understanding
Teacher turnover has been identified as one of the key factors contributing to teacher shortages, which have been growing since 2015. According to the [Learning Policy Institute](https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/product/teacher-turnover-brief), about 8% of teachers leave the profession each year, two-thirds of them for reasons other than retirement and another 8% shift to different schools each year. Additionally, beginning teachers have the highest turnover rates and somewhere between 40-50% of those that go into teaching are gone within five years.

High turnover rates have been found to lower student achievement and are costly for schools. The revolving door of teacher turnover costs school districts upwards of $2.2 billion a year nationally. In 2019, The [Philadelphia Inquirer](https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadephia-district-schools-teacher-turnover-solutions-20190503.html) found that there were 26 schools in the 217 School District of Philadelphia public schools that have lost at least 25 percent of their teachers for four years straight or lost more than one-third in each of the last two school years. Richard Ingersoll, a University of Pennsylvania professor and expert in school staffing, called these findings “appalling.”

The goal of this project is to create a classification model for the School District of Philadelphia that predicts which teachers will leave their current school of employment at the end of a school year. This model will allow district administrators to reduce the negative costs associated with teacher turnover by providing intervention in attempts to retain those teachers who are identified as leaving, or by notifying school administrators to prepare earlier to hire quality teachers to fill vacancies.
